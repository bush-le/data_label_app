# Product Labeler Application

## 1. Overview

The Product Labeler Application is a Python-based GUI tool designed for labeling ground truth on product images. It enables users to accurately annotate key product information such as product name, manufacturer details, importer details, manufacturing date, expiry date, and product type. These ground truth labels provide high-quality, reliable data essential for training and validating AI models.
The application supports:

- Loading and displaying images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, HEIC).
- AI-powered label suggestions using Google Gemini.
- Input validation (phone numbers, dates, character limits, etc.).
- Saving images and metadata into a MySQL database.
- Viewing products by category, viewing details, and deleting entries.
- Exporting data to timestamped JSON files.
- Friendly error handling.

## 2. Main Technologies

- GUI: Tkinter
- Database: MySQL
- AI Suggestion: Google Gemini API
- Image Handling: Pillow (PIL)
- Supporting Libraries: mysql-connector-python, base64, re, json, python-dotenv, etc.

## 3. Key Features

- **Image Loading:** Supports common image formats.
- **AI Suggestions:** Auto-fill fields using Google Gemini AI.
- **Validation:** Checks phone number formats, date formats, expiry date â‰¥ manufacturing date, etc.
- **Data Storage:** Saves images as base64 along with metadata in MySQL, prevents duplicates.
- **Data Management:** Displays products by category, detailed view, and delete option.
- **JSON Export:** Exports all data to a JSON file with a timestamp.
- **Error Handling:** Clear messages for input errors, database connection issues, etc.
